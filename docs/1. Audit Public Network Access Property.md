## Step-by-step scenario

### How to create it

You can deploy a reference scenario from scratch using the [step-by-step-example-audit-pna.ps1](step-by-step-example-audit-pna.ps1) script. It follows the next steps:

1. Creates one resources group to:
    - Deploy every resource that support *publicNetworkAccess* alias to evaluate the policy. Other services could be deployed because a single template is used for all scenarios in this repository.
2. Create the policy an assigment with a scope associated to the resource group where Azure services are deployed.
3. Deploy the resources.
4. Force an Azure Policy compliance scan.

You should wait till the scan is completed to review the Compliance information inside Azure Portal.
