## Step-by-step scenario

### How to create it

You can deploy a reference scenario from scratch using the [step-by-step-example-audit-deny-resources-private-endpoints-outside-subscriptions](4.%20Other%20policies\4.2%20Audit%20resources%20with%20Private%20Endpoints%20outside%20allowed%20subscriptions\step-by-step-example-audit-deny-resources-private-endpoints-outside-subscriptions.ps1) script. It follows the sames steps than policy "Deploy Private Endpoint if not exists"

1. Create three resources group to:
    - Group all networking resources.
    - Deploy required resources for the policy.
    - Deploy every resource that support Private Endpoint to evaluate the policy.
2. Create a virtual network with a default subnet with *privateEndpointNetworkPolicies* property disabled.
3. Create a storage account and a managed identity used by the policy.
4. Create the policy an assigment with a scope associated to the resource group where Azure services are deployed.
5. Assign the proper RBAC permissions to managed identitys.
6. Deploy the resources.

After that, you should wait till the Policy is trigerred and your private endpoints would be created in your networking resource group. Once the Private Endpoints are avaiable you would obtain your compliance results.
